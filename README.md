Tasks:
1. Auto generate pulasr API for node js using protobuf - 0.5D of work
2. Learn the process of how new client (producer and  consumer) connects to pulsar - 2D blocking
The asginee should understand the exact api command should be run in order to connect to pulsar and produce + consume
3. Do a presentation to the team about how a client connects to pulsar - 1D blocking
4. Design - 1D blocking

--- From here all blocked by 2 + 3 ---

4. Create client abstraction - One Person
    - Reconnection (multiple brokers list) - 1D
    - JWT authentication handling - 1D
5. Create producer using the PulsarApi - One Person
    - Support simple produce - 1D
    - Support Chunking(?)  - 1D
    - Support Batching - 1D
6. Create consumer using the PulsarAPi - One Person
    - Support basic consume - 1D
    - Support all acknowledgments types - 1D
    - Support all subscription types - 1D
    - Support Chunking(?) - 1D
7. Good exception handling - 2D
8. Good logging supporting all log levels - 1D 
9. docker compose standalone + nodejs code - 2h
10. Unit tests using the docker compose - 5D Blocked by all above

--- Synchornized time: 9D ---
--- Asynchornized time: Max: 12.2D Min: 4D
--- Total time: Max: 22.2D Min: 14D

Pros:
1. Npm installable on all platforms - 0.4
2. Because this Client is using autogenerated Protobuff we won't need to change code the actual classes on new version of pulsar - 0.2
3. The knowledge of how EXACTLY consumer or producer connects to pulsar will stay strong in the team - 0.2
4. Exceptions and logging made by the team, whenever a nodejs client will have a problem we will know exactly what's wrong - 0.1
5. We will be the maintainers so we will be able to push feature directly to the client if we ever have a problem - 0.1
Cons:
1. In a situation of a bug, we are the team to blame - 0.7
2. Should be maintained by the team (hafia time) as long as we are maintainers - 0.3
